# TextChat
An in-game TextChat plugin for SCP:SL.

## Minimum requirements
[EXILED](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED/releases/5.3.0) **5.3.0+**

[LiteDB](https://github.com/mbdavid/LiteDB) **5.0.12+**

## How to install
Put **TextChat.dll** inside `%appdata%\Plugins` if you're on **Windows** or `~/.config/Plugins` on **Linux**.

Put **LiteDB.dll** inside `%appdata%\Plugins\dependencies` folder if you're using **Windows** or `~/.config/Plugins/dependencies` if you're on **Linux**.

## How to use it
Press **Ã²** or **\`** on your keyboard to open the in-game console, with that, you'll be able to execute commands to chat with other players.

## How to submit a new language

**First method**
- Fork my repository.
- Copy `Localizations\Language.resx` into the `Localization` folder and rename it to `Localizations\Language.XX.resx` where XX are the [language code letters](https://lonewolfonline.net/list-net-culture-country-codes/).
- For example: I want to add the french language into the game, then I'll have to rename the file to `Language.fr.resx`.
- Translate the file with any text editor or C# IDE and push it into your forked repository.
- Open a pull request on my repository with the language you added, if everything is correct, I'll accept it and add it into the plugin.

**Second method**
- Download [Language.resx](https://github.com/iopietro/TextChat/blob/master/TextChat/Localizations/Language.resx), translate it in your language and send it to me on Discord: iopietro#1717, if everything is correct, I'll add it into te plugin.
